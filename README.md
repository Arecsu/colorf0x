# colorf0x

Match the `theme-color` of the website with Firefox's UI

This is how [Safari 15](https://css-tricks.com/safari-15-new-ui-theme-colors-and-a-css-tricks-cameo/) and toolbars on mobile browsers are doing.

Highly inspired and share some code with [Adaptive Tab Bar Colour](https://github.com/easonwong-de/Adaptive-Tab-Bar-Colour/). The main differences:

- Less code
- If the website doesn't have a `theme-color`, it won't change the UI color
- No settings per website. No toggles. Just install and forget
- Adaptive Tab Bar Colour does not have an option to disable its dynamic color algorithm for sites that don't have `theme-color`. colorf0x has been built specifically for this purpose.
- Colors and aesthetic are different

Thanks to Eason Wong for its work with [Adaptive Tab Bar Colour](https://github.com/easonwong-de/Adaptive-Tab-Bar-Colour/) and [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor/).
