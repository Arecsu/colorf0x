Match the `theme-color` of the website with Firefox's UI

This is how [Safari 15](https://css-tricks.com/safari-15-new-ui-theme-colors-and-a-css-tricks-cameo/) and toolbars on mobile browsers are doing.

Highly inspired by [Adaptive Tab Bar Colour](https://github.com/easonwong-de/Adaptive-Tab-Bar-Colour/). Part of the code has been taken from it. The main differences:

- A cleaner codebase with less features
- Reacts only to `theme-color` values from the website. It doesn't have the dynamic color algorithm that tries to match the website's header or background color that Adaptive Tab Bar Colour has.
- No settings per website. No toggles. Just install and forget
- Colors and aesthetic adaptations are different

Thanks to Eason Wong for its work with [Adaptive Tab Bar Colour](https://github.com/easonwong-de/Adaptive-Tab-Bar-Colour/) and [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor/).
